# If q is a prime power, and d = 3, and n is equal to q^((q^r-1)/(q-1)) for some positive integer r, then we know that the Hamming bound is integral, and we know that there is a perfect code with those parameters. So this choice of parameters is not terribly interesting.
#
# So I would filter as follows:

# This function tells us whether the Hamming bound we get for (n,d,q) is exactly the bound of a Hamming code. So if it returns true, then I would omit that triple (n,d,q) from the output.
