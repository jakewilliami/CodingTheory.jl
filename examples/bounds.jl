For your interest, all of this code that I am writing I have published to GitHub.  Once again, I remind you that I have never studied computer science, so no judgement...but here it is: https://github.com/jakewilliami/CodingTheory.jl/blob/master/examples/bounds.jl


I'll see you tomorrow.  All the best!


Jake.
