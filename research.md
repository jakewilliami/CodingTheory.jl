A fair amount of research has gone into ensuring this is an accurate package.  However, I do believe I have only scratched the surface, as it were, of Coding Theory.  I have implemented some code bounds and distances, some polynomial/algebraic functions, but there is much more Coding Theory than is currently in the scope of this package.

This package was actually created in an exploratory attempt at finding some interesting code spaces.  Here are some papers I found helpful in writing this:
  - [Error detecting and error correcting codes (Hamming, 1950)](https://calhoun.nps.edu/bitstream/handle/10945/46756/Hamming_1982.pdf;jsessionid=027619D193DDF740A8CF4DAADBC9CF39?sequence=1);
  - [Notes on digital coding (Golay, 1949)](https://www.lama.univ-savoie.fr/pagesmembres/hyvernat/Enseignement/1718/info607/TP-Golay/golay_paper.pdf);
  - [A survey of perfect codes (van Lint; 1975)](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.rmjm/1250130635);
  - [Bounds on codes over an alphabet of five elements (Bogdanova & Östergård; 2001)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012365X00003836/pdf?md5=c0332c8c63996d1447bdef11a87af7dc&pid=1-s2.0-S0012365X00003836-main.pdf&_valck=1);
  - [On the classification of MDS codes (Kokkala, Krotov, & Östergård; 2014)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/18/7331248/07294677.pdf);
  - [Futher results on the classification of MDS codes (Kokkala & Östergård; 2015)](https://www.aimsciences.org/article/exportPdf?id=6c9701df-4372-46cf-acac-5ef9efdf4244);
  - [An optimum nonlinear code (Nordstrom; 1968)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019995867908352/pdf?md5=b217d91216e8b2ddaa761dbed6107563&pid=1-s2.0-S0019995867908352-main.pdf);

There doesn't seem to be much in the way of previous research/applications of Coding Theory in Julia.  There is [a paper by Ryan Quinn](https://dspace.sunyconnect.suny.edu/bitstream/handle/1951/70206/R%20Quinn%20MS%20Project%20document%2020180507.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) on the topic, but at time of writing, there isn't much else.  If others find this package useful, I woud love to see pull requests and extensions made from this package.
